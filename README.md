# Summary

This repository contains a small application based on Mikko test. I have taken this assignment fairly freely by adding some extras in addition to the objective of the assignment. The goal for me here was to be able to add just a few more pieces of front-end technology so that we could talk about this as well.

I also thought it would be fun to work with techniques that are familiar to iBuildings, but that I had to get used to in part myself. The application is therefore built on the basis of React, Typescript, with some linters and a small piece of redux. I also added some SCSS for the styling of the application.

Of course, much more technology can be added and the application is certainly not yet production ready. But hopefully it will lead to a nice conversation about software development.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
